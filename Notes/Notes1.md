* Linux is modular which means that users can remove and add/remove whatever they need or don't need.
    * Kernel ​= the core of the operating system. Manages the hardware.
    * Daemons​ = background programs that run independent of the user.
    *  Shells​ = the interface that accepts user input and translates it so that the kernel can use it.
    * Graphical Desktop Environmen​t = a collection of software that makes the graphical interface.
* In Linux everything is a file.
* Type of files:
    * Device files
    * Directory files ○ Binary files
    * Regular files
### Software licensing agreement
* A license agreement outlines the rights a user has to a given software
* Types of licensing agreement:
  
Open Source | Closed Source | Free Software
----------- | ------------- | -------------
Software can be distributed for free or a fee. **The source code must be distributed with the software.** | Software can be distributed for free or a fee. ​**The end user has limited access to the software and the source code is not available.** | Software can be distributed for free or a fee. The user has total control of the software and the source code. The software must comply with the 4 freedoms.
