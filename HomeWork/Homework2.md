1. What are the advantages of open source?
    * Anybody can have access to the source code for free.
    * It is transparent to it's user which means that anybody can learn what the software does.
    * People can learn from it and improve its performance.
    * Most importantly, this type of source is reliable and more secure compared to the proprietary versions.
  

2. What are the basic freedoms that make a software open source?
    * Freedom 0 the user can run the program as you wish, for any purpose .
    * Freedom 1 the user can study how the program works, and change it.
    * Freedom 2 the user can redistribute copies.
    * Freedom 3 the user can distribute copies of you modified version.

3. Why do you think people should use the free software/open-source alternative instead of the proprietary version?
    * More Freedom
    * Those version can be constantly updated and the individual can actually work into developing those alternative versions that are available in open source.
    * Students can play around with those versions and get the actual feel of how it would be to work with real source code.
    * Open Source alternatives are usually free for example the alternative of Microsoft word in Linux is LibreOffice which is available for free which is great.
4. Do you agree with Richard Stallman? Do you disagree? Explain your answer.
   I strongly agree with certain points that the speaker makes. First when he started that proprietary program has some power over the user, these softwares control the users because they control what the users can do. He also states the advantages of having an open source software and how all the users can collectively help improve the software which makes it a better thing. In other words the freedom that the software offers allows the user to switch up the software to what they would like to. This is important and in my opinion what the speakers states is important and i agree because we are not aware of what these proprietary softwares do to control us and where our information goes to.
