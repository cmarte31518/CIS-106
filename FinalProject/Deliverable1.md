# Deliverable 1

**Due date**: End-Of-Semester
The students will answer the following questions as a submission for their project’s proposal. The instructor will then approve, deny, or expand on the student’s plan.

### Questions to answer

**Which project will you be completing?**

 I would be working on "Building a Dropbox alternative with NextCloud"

**Why have you chosen this project?**

Honestly the main reason why I selected this project is because I genuinely found it interesting and it would be a project that would not take me as much time as the others. This project grabbed my attention because first NextCloud is an open source and second it is a reliable Dropbox alternative and the most exciting thing is that I would have the opportunity to be the host.


**What are the possible problems, roadblocks, or difficulties you anticipate during the process of completing the project?**

I believe that some of the difficulties that I will be facing are finding the right command and verifying that all the packages that I need for this project are correctly installed because I am not as educated as I wish I was in this kind of environment. Another one would be finding ways to make the the Cloud more secure, even if this is not a requirement for the project after reading and watching a couple of videos I found out that I am able to reenforce the security levels which makes me want to actually experiment and look into it.

**How are you planning to overcome these difficulties?**

I think that the easiest and only way I have to resolve these issues is by doing research. 

**How do you think completing this project will help you in your career?**

I feel that this project would help me in my career because NextCloud is known to be on top of the game and gaining the ability of being able to manipulate such server and offer my future boss the ability of creating the company its own cloud in which we could store and share files among departments by utilizing this platform. Lastly, I hope that after doing more research I find more ideals about how it could benefit me more in the future.
