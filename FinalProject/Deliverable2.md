**The students will list and provide a brief description of the resources that are being used to complete the project. Also, the student will provide a brief explanation of the technologies that he is learning in order to complete the project.**
The main resource that I currently using is YouTube. I have watched a couple of videos about how to set up NextCloud and how to work with NextCloud etc. Also, and went though the videos comments to find any additional input from random people. Honestly YouTube has been the best resource because I am getting more familiar with NextCloud. In this project the technology that I will be using are pretty familiar already and pretty much I have worked with Ubuntu and my Raspberry Pi which is what I will be using to complete my project. The main thing that I am currently learning is the NextCloud Software.

##These are some of the videos that I have been watching
